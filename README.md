Design and Development of Algorithms for Student Performance Monitoring
Abstract:-
The purpose of this project is to make a usable software for student performance evaluation. It has many algorithms to perform functions such as data manipulation, sorting, searching, performance evaluation and profiling. The project is divided into the following modules.
1.	Authentication and Authorization 
2.	Data Manipulation 
3.	Sorting
4.	Searching
5.	Performance Evaluation
6.	Profiling

**Files in the repository:**\n
/Database/Students.txt (it holds information of students)\n
/Database/Marks.txt (it holds marks of students)
/Database/Grades.txt (it holds grades of students)

/Source Code/ADSTU.c    (used to add new students into database)
/Source Code/ADMARKS.c  (used to add marks of student to database)
/Source Code/ADGRADES.c (used to add grades of students into database)
/Source Code/SEARCHST.c (used to search for a given student from the database)
/Source Code/READALL.c  (used to read all students from database)
/Source Code/BUBBLESO.c (used to sort the student data using bubble sort)
/Source Code/SELECSOR.c (used to sort the student data using selection sort)
/Source Code/INSERSOR.c (used to sort the student data using insertion sort)
/Source Code/EVALPER.c  (used to evaluate performance of given student)
